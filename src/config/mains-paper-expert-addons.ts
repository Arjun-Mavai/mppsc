  1: `PAPER I — HISTORY + GEOGRAPHY (GS-I style, bilingual depth)
**OUTPUT NOTE:** Topic prompts for Paper I use the **History‑Rich JSON v1** schema (see TOPIC TASK appendix). Follow that schema when generating the final JSON.

STRUCTURE & VALUE ADDITION (MANDATORY):
1. **Real Meaning & Practical Feel (असली मतलब और व्यावहारिक जीवन से जुड़ाव)**: Start by explaining the true essence of the topic. Make the student FEEL the topic by connecting it to real-life practical examples or current events, rather than just bookish definitions.
2. **Interconnection (बहुआयामी दृष्टिकोण)**: Explicitly show what is included in this topic and how it connects to other subjects (e.g., History connecting to Geography, Polity, or Economy). 
3. **Topper's Secret & Proof (टॉपर सीक्रेट और प्रमाण)**: Provide a specific "Topper's Secret" on how to score maximum marks in this topic. Don't just give a tip; PROVE IT by showing a mini-example of *how to implement it* in the answer (e.g., "Use this specific map or flowchart here to gain +1 mark").
4. **Strict Points & Headings Format (बिंदुवार और उचित शीर्षक)**: The entire model answer must be heavily points-based with proper, engaging headings. Avoid long paragraphs. 

MARK DISCIPLINE (5m & 7m Focus):
- **5 Marks & 7 Marks**: Both must follow the SAME high-quality structure — crisp intro, proper heading, 4-6 bullet points for 5m, and 5-8 bullet points for 7m, ending with a 1-line conclusion. ALWAYS use vertical bullet points.
- **2 Marks**: Ultra-tight definition or two linked facts.
- **11 / 10 Marks**: Intro → Body (Multi-angle headings) → Diagram/Flowchart → Conclusion.

SUBJECT SPECIFICS:
- **History**: Cause → Process → Consequence chain. Add MP linkage (dynasties, revolt, culture, sites). 
- **Geography**: Map + Mechanism + Data. Connect physical features to human response and MP/Indian agriculture.`,

  2: `PAPER II — POLITICAL SCIENCE + SOCIOLOGY
STRUCTURE & VALUE ADDITION (MANDATORY):
1. **Real Meaning & Practical Feel**: Explain the concept practically. For Polity, connect it to daily citizen life or current news. For Sociology, use a relatable Indian society example.
2. **Interconnection**: Weave the topic into other disciplines (Polity ↔ Sociology ↔ Economy). 
3. **Topper's Secret & Proof (टॉपर सीक्रेट और प्रमाण)**: Share a top-tier strategy (like linking an Article with a Supreme Court case or a Sociological thinker) and PROVE how to write it in the exam sheet.
4. **Strict Points & Headings Format**: Use proper markdown headings and bullet points. 

MARK DISCIPLINE (5m & 7m Focus):
- **5 Marks & 7 Marks**: Treat them with the same structural respect. Clear heading, vertical bullet points (4-6 points for 5m, 5-8 points for 7m), and a powerful 1-line synthesis. No long paragraphs!
- **2 Marks**: Precise constitutional language or exact sociological definition.

SUBJECT SPECIFICS:
- **Polity**: Weave Articles (e.g., 14, 19, 21, 32, etc.) and landmark SC cases (Name + Year + Core ratio).
- **Sociology**: Indian concepts with empirical MP flavour (schemes, migration). Avoid empty jargon.`,

  3: `PAPER III — ECONOMICS + SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY & PUBLIC HEALTH
STRUCTURE & VALUE ADDITION (MANDATORY):
1. **Real Meaning & Practical Feel**: Explain Economics/Science mechanisms simply, as if explaining to a layman. Show how this topic impacts everyday life, cost of living, or public health.
2. **Interconnection**: Show the "Economy ↔ Science/Health bridge" (cost, access, equity, externalities).
3. **Topper's Secret & Proof (टॉपर सीक्रेट और प्रमाण)**: Give a "Topper's Secret" such as a specific data point, SDG goal, or index to quote. Provide a tangible example of how implementing this boosts the score.
4. **Strict Points & Headings Format**: Heavily points-based. Use step-by-step headings for science mechanisms.

MARK DISCIPLINE (5m & 7m Focus):
- **5 Marks & 7 Marks**: Must be highly structured. Intro → Subheading → 4-8 bullet points based on marks → 1-line way forward.
- **2 Marks**: Definition + One application/example.
- **11 / 10 Marks**: Problem → Evidence/Data → Policy/Mechanism → Way Forward with MP/India example.

SUBJECT SPECIFICS:
- **Economics**: Structure + Current relevance. Add MP/India statistics or schemes only if accurate.
- **Sci-Tech/Health**: Mechanism first (how it works) → Application → India/MP angle (e.g., telemedicine). Keep MPPSC depth, not PhD depth.`,

  4: `PAPER IV — PHILOSOPHY / PSYCHOLOGY / PUB AD + ETHICS CASES + MANAGEMENT + CASE STUDY PATTERN
This paper uses **11-mark long answers** and **18/20-mark case studies** (per MPPSC scheme). 

STRUCTURE & VALUE ADDITION (MANDATORY):
1. **Real Meaning & Administrative Link**: Explain concepts like Philosophy or Psychology by linking them directly to civil services, public administration, or a District Magistrate's daily life.
2. **Topper's Secret & Proof**: Share an expert strategy (e.g., "Use this specific ethical framework or administrative rule here") and PROVE it by showing a quick diagram layout or an exact catchy phrase to gain +1 mark.
3. **Strict Points & Headings**: Avoid long paragraphs. Use clear, vertical bullet points.

SUBJECT SPECIFICS:
- **Philosophy / thinkers**: Concise biography is useless without **idea → method → ethics/public service link**.
- **Psychology / attitude**: Link trait → behaviour → admin life → ethical safeguard.
- **Public administration / Management**: Principles + Indian constitutional context + small governance examples.

CASE STUDY EXCELLENCE (CRITICAL INSTRUCTION):
When answering a Case Study (प्रकरण अध्ययन), you MUST follow these strict rules:
1. **Multi-Part Questions (e.g., 4.1(1), 4.1(2), etc.)**: If the case study stem contains multiple sub-questions at the bottom, YOU MUST ANSWER EVERY SINGLE SUB-QUESTION sequentially. Use Markdown headings for each sub-question (e.g., \`## (4.1)(1) जिलाधिकारी की प्रमुख जिम्मेदारी\`, \`## (4.1)(2) विकास संबंधी कार्य\`). Do not merge them into one generic essay.
2. **Expert Format**: For the analytical parts of the case, you MUST use the standard ethical framework headings: \`## Stakeholders Involved (हितधारक)\`, \`## Core Values / Ethical Dilemma (नैतिक दुविधा)\`, and \`## Action Plan / Decision (निर्णय एवं कार्यवाही)\`. Write with the commanding tone of a Senior IAS Officer.
3. **Deep Expert Insights (छात्रों के लिए मार्गदर्शन)**: In the 'expert insights' or intro section, explicitly teach the student HOW to read this case study. Break down the hidden administrative challenges and show them how a topper maps the syllabus (e.g., "This case tests your coordination skills and crisis management"). Make it immensely helpful for the student.`,

  5: `PAPER V — GENERAL HINDI & GRAMMAR (PURE HINDI ONLY)
This is **NOT** GS: focus on **Vyakaran rules, exceptions, examples**, sandhi-samās, upsarg-pratyay, muhavare, alankār recognition, apathit / pathit style precision. 
Model answers should sound like **exam Hindi** — शुद्ध, संयत. Use a strict **Rule → Example → Common Trap** pattern. Make the content extremely "learning-focused" so students feel they are getting expert insights. Give exact marks formatting.
CRITICAL: Since this is a pure Hindi paper, you MUST set all \`_en\` keys to \`null\` or empty arrays. Write the pure Hindi content ONLY in the \`_hi\` keys. Do not use English anywhere unless explaining a transliteration rule.`,

  6: `PAPER VI — HINDI ESSAY + DRAFT / REPORT / MEMO (100 marks; PURE HINDI ONLY)
WORD LIMITS & FORMATTING RULES:
- 50 Marks Essay: Target ~1000 words. Provide a highly dense, expert essay spanning this length. At the very top, label it explicitly: "**निबंध (लगभग 1000 शब्द)**".
- 25 Marks Essay: Target ~500 words. At the very top, label it explicitly: "**निबंध (लगभग 500 शब्द)**".
- 25 Marks Draft/Report (प्रारूप लेखन): Target ~250 words. सरकारी शैली (संदर्भ, विषय, मांग/निर्णय, समापन)। At the very top, label it: "**प्रारूप लेखन (लगभग 250 शब्द)**".

STRUCTURE & FLOW (The Golden Thread):
1. **Dynamic Engaging Start (प्रस्तावना)**: Start with a powerful, engaging hook. ALWAYS begin with a quote from a relevant philosopher, a famous Indian personality, or a precise Constitutional Article / legal backing (especially for Polity/Social issues). Use Markdown blockquotes \`> \` for these quotes so the UI highlights them beautifully.
2. **Multidimensional Interconnection (बहुआयामी दृष्टिकोण)**: The essay MUST interconnect multiple subjects. Show the student how a single topic weaves through History, Geography, Polity, Economy, Environment, and Society. Demonstrate a broad "Administrator's Mindset" (प्रशासकीय सोच).
3. **Seamless Flow (प्रवाह)**: Maintain a single unbroken thread (एक सूत्र) from start to finish. Paragraphs must transition naturally into each other.
4. **Powerful Conclusion (निष्कर्ष)**: Summarize the core thesis beautifully. End with a forward-looking, visionary statement or a solution-oriented closing thought. It should feel like a satisfying, definitive end.

EXPERT INSIGHTS & COACHING (expert_insights_hi):
- Teach the student HOW to brainstorm this specific essay.
- Show them the "Interconnection Mind Map" (कि कैसे इस विषय को इतिहास, भूगोल, राजनीति और अर्थशास्त्र से जोड़ा जाए).
- Explain the psychology of the examiner and why starting with the chosen quote/article creates maximum impact.
- Give them a checklist for the flow (Intro -> Body -> Interconnections -> Conclusion).

TONE: Pure, literate, expert-level Hindi (उम्दा और प्रवाहमयी हिंदी निबंध विशेषज्ञ की तरह). 
CRITICAL: Since this is a pure Hindi paper, you MUST set all \`_en\` keys to \`null\` or empty arrays. Write the pure Hindi content ONLY in the \`_hi\` keys. No English allowed.`,
